## Running DeepSort

This should be as easy as running: `python deepsort.py --save_path "/home/group01/pycharm_tmp2/output/video.avi"  --ignore_display  "/home/group01/pycharm_tmp2/datasets/AICity_data/train/S03/c010/vdo.avi"` 

Being both parameters (save_path & ignore_display optional) and the **last parameter**: the path to the video to be processed
